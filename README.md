# Event-Planning-and-Creation
Within this Python project, I created a program that took in user input and then constructed a file based on such input. 
The program took in input for an event that a user would like to create. 
The user would input the whether or not they wished to create an event, register attendees for their events, view their event, or quit the program while saving their inputted data. 
Based on the information inputted by the user, a file would be created for the user's convenience that listed the event's name as well as the registered individuals' names along with their emails.
